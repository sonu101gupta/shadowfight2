        <p>Shadow Fight 2 originally released on mobile devices back in 2014, only now being ported to the Nintendo Switch and other modern consoles. Mixing fighting game mechanics with the gameplay of an action RPG, the game’s campaign involves fighting your way across various lands in order to seal away the demons the playable protagonist – known only as the “Shadow” – released when searching for a worthy opponent to fight. Additionally, the game also offers local PvP, with a wealth of characters and stages available for use.

            The opening cinematic and tutorials introduce you to the basic combat mechanics, and raise awareness of the gear and weapon systems that become integral to the combat as you complete the campaign and other “side-quest” battles (such as tournaments and duels). In order to progress, you must constantly acquire and upgrade your weaponry and armour, or else the damage inflicted becomes too great to withstand. Annoyingly, each new weapon and armour set is locked behind an experience wall, meaning you must grind and grind to be able to proceed.</p>
